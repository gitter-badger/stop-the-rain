# Stop the rain!

This is an app that will stop the rain for ya.

Deployed at [stoptherain.herokuapp.com](https://stoptherain.herokuapp.com).

Also, this is very open open source. Ask, and commit access shall be granted.
It's something we're trying to hack together during the breaks of #webrebels.

## Development

First, install dependencies:

    npm install

Second, start the server

    npm start

Third, if you're developing, run the frontend build:

    gulp build

Also, ``gulp watch``.

Happy hacking!
