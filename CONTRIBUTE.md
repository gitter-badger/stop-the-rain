# We're so glad you're here!

If you're reading this, you're at least wondering about how you can help out
with making a difference to this product that is just pure sillyness.

## Do you want to help out?

Send us a pull request, and if you get it accepted, you'll get full commit
access.

Once you get commit access, please continue creating pull requests and get them
reviewed by another committer. This way we don't break the build.

[@selbekk](https://www.github.com/selbekk) is the deploy guy, so go nag him if
you want to deploy the master branch to Heroku.

## What's there to do?

Pick an issue and fix it! If there aren't any issues, but you can think of
something to do, make an issue and do it.

## Code of conduct

If you're a douche, you'll get banned.
