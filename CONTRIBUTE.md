# We're so glad you're here!

If you're reading this, you're at least wondering about how you can help out
with making a difference to this product that is just pure sillyness.

## Do you want to help out?

Send us a pull request, and if you get it accepted, you'll get full commit
access.

Fix issues and implement new features on feature branches - never directly on
master.

## Deployments

Master is always deployed whenever it's pushed to, so please make sure you keep
that branch deployable. Always merge locally and do a test-run before pushing
changes to master.

## What's there to do?

Pick an issue and fix it! If there aren't any issues, but you can think of
something to do, make an issue and do it.

## Code of conduct

If you're a douche, you'll get banned. If you're not a douche, you'll not get
banned.
